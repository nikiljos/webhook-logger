# Express Server to view content of incoming webhooks


### How to run
```
npm init

npm install express

nodemon index.js
```
Use [`ngrok`](https://ngrok.com/) to expose your port to recieve webhooks

### Why I built it
I was looking for something to view the data of incoming webhooks of different services so that I could get sample data directly instead of randomly searching docsðŸ˜€
